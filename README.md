# document-store-tests

This is a collection of tests for the [Document Store](https://github.com/concord-consortium/document-store).

Open the test in JMeter and update the top-level User Defined Variables to point to the servers you want to use, with the users you want to test with. Then start it up.

*WARNING!* This puts a lot of load on whichever server you're testing, so be ready for it to crash, have errors or fill up your free disk space.
